Since a while my DS203 v2.72 8MB was not able to reliably save files, only CFG were working, also filesystem get corrupted very often.
I tried all combination of:
SYS_B152 
SYS_B160 
SYS_B162 
SYS_B164
JPA Alterbios by patching all the above
formatting the flash with any kind of old dos and windows devices, virtual machines
v113 firmware, B251 firmware and any older release of Wildcat firmware.

Nothing worked, I was close to throw away the scope thinking the flash got broken after 7 years.

Then I fixed a bug in the Alterbios that used to write/read using 512B as block size regardless the flash disk size.
Now it uses 512B on 2M and 4096B on 8M.

Every issue disappeared, I realized it was partially working with CFG because those files were 512B (now 4096B), with other filesizes the filesystem got messed.

Here https://github.com/Turro75/AlterBIOS/tree/test You can find my fork of Alterbios (not sure JPA can work on it anymore) where I put a Compiled folder with all binaries ready to flash.
Installation is easy:
load HEX file on DFU or

load ADR+BIN on DFU or

load BIN with stm32flash (following debrick instructions) 
I use these commands on my linux desktop:
	stm32flash /dev/ttyUSB0  -S 0x8044000:0x1fff -w ALTBIOS.BIN
	stm32flash /dev/ttyUSB0  -S 0x8004000:0x7fff -w ALT_B164.BIN
